 <h1> Q:Explain what a data center is and how they relate to the cloud
?</h1>
  
 <p align="justify">Cloud computing is the deliverance of  serivce as computing instead of as a product. 
 In this, distributed resources, software, as well as information are provided to computers 
 and several other devices as a utility over a network. A data center is a service used for 
 residential computer systems, as well as its associated elements, such as storage systems and telecommunications. 
 In the case of traditional data centers, servers are co-located and dependent on failure, whereas, in the case 
 of Cloud servers, servers are integrated and fault-tolerant. Reasons for moving from traditional computing to 
 Cloud computing were discussed along with the benefits of Cloud computing. Cloud computing is a technology that 
 allows the user to access resources by means of front end machines; there is no requirement to install any software 
Cloud Applications or Software as a Service (SAAS) refers to web services that can be used over the internet with absolutely
 no server and any application maintenance needed. These services may free of charge or may come with a subscription. 
 The companies that provide these services take care of all the software installations, maintenance, and update needs.
 Clients are just required to sign a contract with these companies for a number of years for software and licenses. 
 Various financial companies are using SAAS services for their budgeting solutions from vendors like Clarity 
 (which is now a part of IBM), Hyperion, and Host Analytics, etc. Other examples include companies like Facebook 
 and SalesForce. Cloud computing has the capability to access the data remotely from any location around the globe. </p>
